# None of the Audio Intelligence demo-lifecycle tests are present in this offline suite - as of
# the current upstream main (checked out by CLONE OR UPDATE WEBSERVER OOB DEMO REPO), AudioDsp.vue
# offers exactly three demos: Speech Enhancement, Audio Classification, and TVM Inference (there
# is no "Custom Audio Pipeline"/GStreamerPipeline.vue tile in this checkout at all - confirmed
# against github.com/TexasInstruments/webserver-oob-demo, which has only a single "main" branch).
# Speech Enhancement and Audio Classification's backends both fully support MOCK=1 (see their
# server-plugin.js), but the page-header Run/Stop button that every lifecycle test needs to click
# is gated page-wide, regardless of which demo is selected, on
# ":disabled=\"!canRun && !demoRunning\"" where canRun requires tvmReady/tvmWasReady - and that ref
# only ever flips true once demo-coordinator.js's probeTvmReadiness() observes a real
# /sys/class/remoteproc0/state == "running" plus a live PING/PONG against the real
# tvm-model-daemon socket. There is no MOCK branch anywhere in that module, so on a hardware-less
# host the button is permanently stuck disabled on "Preparing Demo...", regardless of the demo's
# own MOCK support. TVM Inference itself is also unsupported offline independently of that gate -
# its server-plugin.js explicitly returns {status:'error', message:'TVM inference requires real
# hardware - MOCK mode not supported'} under MOCK=1. See
# AM62D_WEBSERVER_OOB_GUI_EVM_AUDIO_DSP_SPEECH_ENHANCEMENT_DEMO_LIFECYCLE /
# ..._AUDIO_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_SWITCH / ..._DEMO_SWITCH_CONFIRM_DIALOG in the EVM suite, where
# the real C7x/TVM daemon actually exists, for this coverage.

AM62D_WEBSERVER_OOB_GUI_OFFLINE_DSP_COMPUTE_SIGCHAIN_BIQUAD_DEMO_LIFECYCLE
    [Documentation]    Runs the Sigchain Biquad EQ demo on the DSP Acceleration page against the
    ...    mock backend and confirms the status text reflects a connected mock run.
    ...    Deliberately NOT "Audio DSP Offload"/"2D FFT Offload": both gate run() on
    ...    GET /sigchain-biquad/check-overlay reporting {active:false} (no competing DSP
    ...    firmware overlay), but demos/sigchain-biquad/server-plugin.js hardcodes
    ...    {active:true,mock:true} for that endpoint under MOCK=1 - so those two are
    ...    permanently blocked offline, while Sigchain Biquad EQ (which requires the
    ...    opposite: overlayActive===true) is the only DSP Acceleration demo actually
    ...    runnable in MOCK mode. See EVM suite for Audio DSP Offload / 2D FFT Offload
    ...    coverage.
